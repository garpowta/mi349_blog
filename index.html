    <h2>Video Game Releasing</h2>

    <p>Video game companies have semi-strict timelines for realesing new video game.  For example, Call of Duty has a rotation between three companies (<em>Treyarch, Activision</em>, and <em>Infinity Ward</em>).  Each year one of the companies releases a Call of Duty, while the other two continue to make theirs.</p>
    
    <p>Some ways video game companies are able to market their games is by showing them off at various game fests.  This year however, Koch Media has announced they will not be featuring <em>Saints Row, Metro, Dead Island</em>, and <em>TimeSplitters</em> at their Summer Game Fest.  These games are extrememly popular throughout the gaming community.  Making this announcement could actually hurt the festival because people would only watch the livestream to see what the new Dead Island game would look like for instance.  Knowing they will not show the game, this person may not tune in the the stream.</p>

    <p>Going back to what I first said about semi-strict timelines, this is because when a game company releases the game, they expect to release new content for that game via DLC (downloadable content).  This content typically costs money for the player to be able to download, but these DLC's allow the company more time in creating the video game next in the series.  Player's can only play a game for so long, before it becomes too repetitive and eventually, boring.  This is why the timeline needs some strictness so game companies do not take over over a few years to create a game.</p>
    <p>Some games take more than a few years to create however.  Games like Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto (GTA) take a lot longer to make because they allow the player roam around an open world.  The last Skyrim to be released was, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>.  This was released back in 2011 with the sixth Skyrim still in production.  They want to ensure everything works correctly, especially after seeing what happened to the Cyberpunk 2077 release.  The game was not fully complete, and had many glitches throughout the campaign.</p>

    <p><em>The Elder Scrolls V</em> was released back in 2011.  It has been almost a decade since the initial release.  This was and is one the best open-world games ever created.  The big question now is when <em>Bethesda</em> will release <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>.  With the current Skyrim being out for over a decade, player's are getting concerned whether or not the game will ever come out.  In 2018, Bethesda released a short trailer that lasted under a minute showing <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, but Bethesda also said they will release <em>Starfield</em> before they release the new <em>Elder Scrolls</em>.</p>
    There is some speculation that the new Skyrim will not come out until 2024.  The release of the new Xbox and PS5 do play a factor in this release because the game is going to be so massive and require a lot of space and power to play.
    <p>Skyrim takes so much time to make because there are hundreds of quests the player does.  With a main storyline that the player does not have to follow, the makers have to ensure each side and infividual quest does not mess up the main quest.  Another reason is due to the different races throughout the land.  The player is able to choose what type of player they are, whether it be an Elf, Nord, Khajiit, Redguard, and many others.  These different races provide different skills the player utilizes.</p>
