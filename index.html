    <p>Video game companies have semi-strict timelines for realesing new video game.  For example, Call of Duty has a rotation between three companies (<em>Treyarch, Activision, and Infinity Ward</em>).  Each year one of the companies releases a Call of Duty, while the other two continue to make theirs.</p>
    
    <p>Some ways video game companies are able to market their games is by showing them off at various game fests.  This year however, Koch Media has announced they will not be featuring <em>Saints Row, Metro, Dead Island</em>, and <em>TimeSplitters</em> at their Summer Game Fest.  These games are extrememly popular throughout the gaming community.  Making this announcement could actually hurt the festival because people would only watch the livestream to see what the new Dead Island game would look like for instance.  Knowing they will not show the game, this person may not tune in the the stream.</p>
